# Data-Warehousing

In this project, We used several datasets ranging from weather and pollution data to casualities and crime data. Each of the 7 datasets (CSVs, Excel, JSON) used were first cleaned and structured and then integrated into different databases such as MariaDB, Snowflake, SQL server and Apache Hadoop. Each of these dataset had a common key (Postal Code).

After setting up the data, We used PySpark and SQL queries to retract, join and query data from each database.

Once the data was joined, We used Power BI to generate visualisations and find insights in the data.

All of this was done with the help of an Ubuntu VM which was setup using Azure.

This was a group project!!
